# Toki Pona words and grammar

The the core vocublary of tokui is derived from Toki Pona. I shortened any word with more than three letters. Many of the altered words are recognizable. Some of them were completely changed.

Tokui grammar, too, is based on Toki Pona. Most any Toki Pona sentence can be trivially translated to tokui by a 1-1 replacement of words. Here are some example Toki Pona sentence translated to tokui:
