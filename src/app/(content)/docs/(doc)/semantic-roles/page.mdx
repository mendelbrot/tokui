# semantic roles

## intro

Here are some resources for learning about semantic roles. The Ithkuil section on case morphology has a good explanation of the use of semantic roles. That's where I was first exposed to this concept. One of the main reasons for tokui is to try out the extensive use of semantic roles in a manner similar to Ithkuil. FrameNet is interesting to browse. It has a comprehensive body of examples of semantic roles in use.

- [Ithkuil Case Morphology](https://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_04_case.htm)
- [FrameNet](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/frameIndex)
- [Wikipedia Thematic Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_relation)
- [VerbNet discussion](https://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/verbnet.html)
- [Verb index reference pages](https://uvi.colorado.edu/references_page)

Note that terms **semantic role**, **case**, and **thematic relation** have overlapping meanings and are often interchangeable. Likewise for **modality** and **mood** introduced below.

## tokui sentence structure

This is the structure of a clause with tokui semantic role grammar:

<span className="font-semibold text-lg">
  <span className="text-purple-500">(MODE)</span> (
  <span className="text-green-500">ROLE</span>{' '}
  <span className="text-orange-500">NOUN</span>)... (li{' '}
  <span className="text-blue-500">VERB</span>)
  <span className="text-purple-500">(MODE)</span> (
  <span className="text-green-500">ROLE</span>{' '}
  <span className="text-orange-500">NOUN</span>)...
</span>

The parts of the clause are defined in this table:

<table className="table-auto">
  <caption>the parts of a clause</caption>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="border">
        <span className="text-purple-500">MODE</span>
      </td>
      <td className="border">
        The part of the clause I call **mode** (aka mood, modality in other texts) is used to say what kind of clause it is is in the folowing senses:

        The most basic usage is, mode specifies if the clause is a statement, a question, or a command/request.

        I also use mode to express if the clause is: a quote, a paraphrase, a desired outcome (I hope that...), a permissive (you may...), a possibility (maybe...), a doubt (I doubt that...), and so on.

        Mode can be a sequence of multiple words. Mode is placed at the beginning of the clause. Mode is optional.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="border">
        <span className="text-blue-500">VERB</span>
      </td>
      <td className="border">
      The **verb** expresses the action predicate of the clause. The verb is a relation that connects the nouns of the clause.

      A verb is optional: In tokui, some combinations of roles determine the relation on their own without requiring a verb. A clause can have at most one verb.

      The verb can be placed anywhere in the clause, provided it is not before the mode or between a noun and its role. A verb can have multiple words. It is identified as the verb by the particle **li** placed before it.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="border">
        <span className="text-green-500">ROLE</span>
      </td>
      <td className="border">
      The verb is a relation that connects the nouns. Each noun requires a role. The noun's **role** (aka semantic role) expresses the way that it participates in the relation. If there is no verb in the clause, then the relation of the clause is determined by the semantic roles of the clause themselves. The tokui semantic roles are listed in the next.section.

      The semantic role is a single two-letter word that is placed before its noun.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="border">
        <span className="text-orange-500">NOUN</span>
      </td>
      <td className="border">
        A **noun** is an entity that participates in the clause.

        The noun can be placed anywhere in the clause, provided it is not before the mode. A noun can have multiple words. Each noun is identified as a noun in the clause because it has a semantic role placed before it.
      </td>
    </tr>

## examples

Each of the examples below is just one of many ways to translate the given sentence. These are some of the choices that can alter the translation: the order of the items in a clause can be different; parts of the clause can be added or left out depending on what the speaker wants to say or leave unsaid (implied); there can be different choices for the semantic roles; The entire phrase can be structured differently.

<InfoBlock subtitle translation="I'll give you the book tomorrow.">
  ep posuk li pan in lip
</InfoBlock>

<InfoBlock subtitle translation="Their cheerfulness is infuriating.">
  li kam ligai ul hipon ona
</InfoBlock>

<InfoBlock subtitle translation="The way they're playing is delightful to see.">
  li kam lipoi ul ki he ef iyo li umi al ona
</InfoBlock>

<InfoBlock subtitle translation="Let's talk about our plans for the weekend.">
  o kam li tok el ki el tonas ep popag
</InfoBlock>

<InfoBlock subtitle translation="Let's plan our weekend.">
  o kam li tonas el popag
</InfoBlock>

<InfoBlock
