# semantic roles

## intro

Here are some resources for learning about semantic roles. The Ithkuil section on case morphology has a good explanation of the use of semantic roles. That's where I was first exposed to this concept. One of the main reasons for tokui is to try out the extensive use of semantic roles in a manner similar to Ithkuil. FrameNet is interesting to browse. It has a comprehensive body of examples of semantic roles in use.

- [Ithkuil Case Morphology](https://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_04_case.htm)
- [FrameNet](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/frameIndex)
- [Wikipedia Thematic Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_relation)
- [VerbNet discussion](https://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/verbnet.html)
- [Verb index reference pages](https://uvi.colorado.edu/references_page)

Note that terms **semantic role**, **case**, and **thematic relation** have overlapping meanings and are often interchangeable. Likewise for **modality** and **mood** introduced below.

## tokui sentence structure

This is the structure of a clause with tokui semantic role grammar:

<span className="font-semibold text-lg">
  <span className="text-purple-500">(MODE)</span> (
  <span className="text-green-500">ROLE</span>{' '}
  <span className="text-orange-500">NOUN</span>)... (li{' '}
  <span className="text-blue-500">VERB</span>) (
  <span className="text-green-500">ROLE</span>{' '}
  <span className="text-orange-500">NOUN</span>)...
</span>

The parts of the clause are defined in this table:

<table className="table-auto">
  <caption>the parts of a clause</caption>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="border">
        <span className="text-purple-500">MODE</span>
      </td>
      <td className="border">
        The part of the clause I call **mode** (aka mood, modality in other texts) is used to say what kind of clause it is is in the following senses:

        The most basic usage is, mode specifies if the clause is a statement, a question, or a command/request.

        I also use mode to express if the clause is: a quote, a paraphrase, a desired outcome (I hope that...), a permissive (you may...), a possibility (maybe...), a doubt (I doubt that...), and so on.

        Mode can be a sequence of multiple words. Mode is placed at the beginning of the clause. Mode is optional.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="border">
        <span className="text-blue-500">VERB</span>
      </td>
      <td className="border">
      The **verb** expresses the action predicate of the clause. The verb is a relation that connects the nouns of the clause.

      A verb is optional: In tokui, some combinations of roles determine the relation on their own without requiring a verb. A clause can have at most one verb.

      The verb can be placed anywhere in the clause, provided it is not before the mode or between a noun and its role. A verb can have multiple words. It is identified as the verb by the particle **li** placed before it.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="border">
        <span className="text-green-500">ROLE</span>
      </td>
      <td className="border">
      The verb is a relation that connects the nouns. Each noun requires a role. The noun's **role** (aka semantic role) expresses the way that it participates in the relation. If there is no verb in the clause, then the relation of the clause is determined by the semantic roles of the clause themselves. The tokui semantic roles are listed in the next.section.

      The semantic role is a single two-letter word that is placed before its noun.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="border">
        <span className="text-orange-500">NOUN</span>
      </td>
      <td className="border">
        A **noun** is an entity that participates in the clause.

        The noun can be placed anywhere in the clause, provided it is not before the mode. A noun can have multiple words. Each noun is identified as a noun in the clause because it has a semantic role placed before it.
      </td>
    </tr>

## tokui roles

There is no definitive list of semantic roles: ithkuil has 68. Lists from other sources generally have around 15 to 45. FrameNet has hundreds, many of which are domain specific for certain group of verbs. I made my own list for tokui instead of copying Ithkuil's because some of the ithkuil cases are tailored specifically for that language in the way they interact with ithkuil affixes and other morphemes. Also, some of the Ithkuil cases are more specific or nuanced than I wanted for tokui.

I have selected 36 roles for tokui. I identified seven categories of roles. From each category I chose one role to be the category's representative (this is mostly to aid in learning by dividing to list into more manageable chucks, and is not in any way rigorous). In the lists below, pressing a role reveals the definition.

<div className="border rounded-xl px-4">

## sub-clauses

Tokui uses a technique derived from ithkuil (case frames) for compound sentences. This technique is different from natural languages as far as I know. It is an alternative to the subordinate (or dependant) clause that is more versatile but can be slightly more verbose.

Here's an example: _I see the dog chasing the bird._ In this example, _the dog chasing the bird_ is the subordinate clause.

In Toki Pona, this would be translated as two sentences like so:

<InfoBlock subtitle translation="I see this: the dog chases the bird.">
  mi luk e ni : wel li ta wao
</InfoBlock>

With tokui's extended grammar, one can use **ki** to enter a sub-clause and _i_ to exit a sub-clause. (If the subclause ends the sentence, then the final **i** is omitted.) if also using semantic roles, the entire sub-clause is given a semantic role, placed before the _ki_. Here's how the example would be written with subclauses:

<InfoBlock subtitle translation="I see the dog chasing the bird.">
  mi luk e ki wel li ta wao
</InfoBlock>

(The final _i_ is omitted because the end of the sub-clause is also the end of the sentence.) 

Here's the sentence again, this time, using semantic roles:

<InfoBlock subtitle translation="I see the dog chasing the bird.">
  uf mi el ki ak wel li ta up wao
</InfoBlock>

Tokui subclauses have an interesting tool/concept called marking the head (again, this is taken from Ithkuil). The head is marked with the word **he** placed before the role. When the head is marked, the head is the part of the subclause that has the sub-clause's role in the main sentence, and the rest of the subclause is peripheral information. 

Going to the example again, if no head is marked, then the person is saying they see the whole thing, the dog chasing the bird. It's a plain statement describing what they see.

If the dog is marked as the head, then the person is specifically saying they see the dog, and fact that it's chasing a bird is peripheral or identifying information. For instance, you're with your buddy at the dog park. There are many dogs playing, and one of them is chasing a bird. Your buddy points this out to you. They say _"look at that dog chasing the bird."_ This would be translated as:

<InfoBlock subtitle translation="Look at that dog chasing the bird.">
  o li luk el ki he ak wel li ta up wao
</InfoBlock>


## more role examples

<InfoBlock subtitle translation="The way they're playing is delightful to see.">
  li kam lipoi ul ki he ef iyo li umi al ona
</InfoBlock>

<InfoBlock subtitle translation="Let's talk about our plans for the weekend.">
  o kam li tok el ki el tonas ep popag
</InfoBlock>

<InfoBlock subtitle translation="Let's plan our weekend.">
  o kam li tonas el popag
</InfoBlock>

<InfoBlock
  subtitle
  translation="Accordign to my supplier, the cost of grain increased from $6/bag to $10/bag."
>
  el ki en 1 4 li ane el gan han of gan / pok op 6 i of yapan mi
</InfoBlock>

Each example just one of many ways to translate the given sentence. These are some of the choices that can alter the translation: the order of the items in a clause can be different; parts of the clause can be added or left out depending on what the speaker wants to say or leave unsaid (implied); there can be different choices for the semantic roles; the entire phrase can be structured differently.
